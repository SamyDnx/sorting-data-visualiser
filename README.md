# Data Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This project is a Python-based visualizer for data sorting algorithms using the `pygame` library. It provides an interactive way to observe and understand how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing their sorting processes step by step.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: 
  - **Bubble Sort**: Visualizes the classic Bubble Sort algorithm.
  - **Insertion Sort**: Visualizes the Insertion Sort algorithm.
  - **Merge Sort**: Planned feature (to be implemented).
- **Array Generation**:
  - Generate random arrays.
  - Generate pre-sorted arrays.
  - Generate reversed arrays.
- **Visualization**:
  - Sorting steps are shown in real-time with colored bars representing data.
  - Animations highlight the sorting progress and completion.
- **Interactivity**: 
  - Choose between different sorting algorithms.
  - Generate new datasets to be sorted.
  - Replay the sorting process on demand.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithms-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-algorithms-visualizer
